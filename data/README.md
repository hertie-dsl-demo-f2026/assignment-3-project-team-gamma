# Data

**Do not commit raw data.** Explain here where the data came from and how a marker can
obtain it, then fetch it with a script.

- **Source:** <name, organisation, URL>
- **Licence / terms of use:** <what you are permitted to do with it>
- **Collection period:** <dates>
- **Unit of observation:** <one row is one ...>
- **Retrieved on:** <date>
- **How to obtain it:**

```bash
# e.g. python -m src.fetch_data   (writes data/raw/, which .gitignore excludes)
```

If the data contain personal information, say what is included, why it is necessary, and how
it is protected. If the source requires registration, say so - a marker who cannot obtain
the data cannot reproduce your result, and reproducibility is 3 of the 25 marks.
